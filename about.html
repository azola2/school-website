                  <p> manyano high is located in the township of Khayelitsha. Manyano High School was established in 2001
                       but for the first eight years of its existence it
                    shared facilities with a primary school in an area called Site B. The primary school occupied
                    the premises in the morning, with Manyano taking over for afternoon lessons. In 2009,
                     the school’s own buildings situated two kilometres away in a relatively well-off
                    formal area called Ilitha Park were finally completed.In the period 2010-2018, 
                    the number of learners at Manyano gradually increased. Today the
                    school has around 1300 learners on its books each year, most of whom come from the poor
                    neighbourhoods surrounding their old Site B location.

                    <p>In 2013, the school’s Matric pass rate rose dramatically from 63.5 per cent in
                        2012 to 80.9 per cent. Unlike at many disadvantaged schools in South Africa, a high attrition
                        rate of weaker learners between Grades 10 and 12 could not be credited for the dramatic
                        improvement of Manyano’s 2013 results. Proving that the 2013 results were no fluke,
                         Manyano’s Matrics enjoyed an 80.6 per cent
                        NSC pass in 2014, with 44 bachelor level passes and 49 diploma passes among the 144
                        learners who wrote. Even more encouraging was that Manyano High School came fourth in the Western Cape in terms of public schools
                        with the most improved NSC results. The school was consequently given an NSC Award by
                        the Premier of the Western Cape, the only school from Khayelitsha to enjoy this honour in
                        2014.1
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        Then, in 2016, Manyano raised the bar yet again, achieving an NSC pass rate of 90.3
                        percent, with no less than 93 bachelor-level passes. Proving again that this move towards
                        becoming a top-performing school was sustainable, Manyano’s Matrics obtained a 90.1
                        percent pass rate at the end of 2017, with only 16 out of the 161 candidates failing. Although
                        there were fewer bachelor-level passes, the school still enabled 64 learners to qualify for
                        university. Indeed, Manyano was the second-best performing state school (excluding former
                        Model-C schools) in the Metro East Education District.
